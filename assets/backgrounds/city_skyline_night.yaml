# Animation suggestions (for future implementation)
animation_notes: |
  - Searchlight beams should rotate slowly
  - Vehicle trails should animate horizontally across screen
  - Neon signs could flicker subtly
  - Window lights could have random twinkling effect
  - Fog layers could drift slowly

# Color palette reference
color_palette:
  dominant: "Deep blue-purple night sky"
  accents:
    - "Cyan/magenta neon"
    - "Warm orange industrial glow"
    - "Cool blue atmospheric lighting"
  contrast: "Bright neon against dark silhouettes"
